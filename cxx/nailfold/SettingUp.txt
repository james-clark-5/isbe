Check out VXL under git as per the instructions in http://sourceforge.net/p/vxl/wiki/Git-Download-VXL/


Although this is not my ideal, I recommend creating a source directory for C++ source code that uses VXL but is not part of the VXL repository (e.g. ISBE libraries). I call this 'external':

/src/
  vxl/
    core/
    ...
    external/
      isbe/
        isbe_apm/
        isbe_apps/
    ...
    vcl/

(This is the only way I could structure the source directory such that the documentation would build for the ISBE libraries.)


CVS checkout the isbe_apps folder.


Create a /src/vxl/CMakeListsLocal.txt file containing:

	SUBDIRS( external/isbe )


Create /src/vxl/external/isbe/CMakeLists.txt with (switched) includes for the ISBE libraries:

	OPTION( BUILD_ISBE_APPS "Build ISBE_APPS" NO )
	IF ( BUILD_ISBE_APPS )
	    SUBDIRS( isbe_apps )
	ENDIF ( BUILD_ISBE_APPS )


Run CMake on the /src/vxl folder to configure the build. (I always find it better to output to an out-of-source folder such as /bin.)


Create an empty /src/vxl/v3p/j2k/CMakeLists.txt file to avoid a CMake error. (Why they didn't include this in the repository is anybody's guess.)


Make a copy of isbe_apps/nailfold/tools/ncm_sandpit.cxx.txt and rename it to ncm_sandpit.cxx Do the same for isbe_apps/nailfold/qtools/ncm_qsandpit/ncm_qsandpit.cxx.txt


Disable the VXL core and contrib libraries that you don't need (brl, cul, oul, oxl, rpl, prip, gel, etc...).


Enable the BUILD_ISBE_APPS flag to add the isbe_apps folder to the build tree.


Enable the BUILD_ISBE_APPS_NAILFOLD flag to add the nailfold folder. Disable BUILD_ISBE_APPS_* for everything else.


Enable the BUILD_ISBE_APPS_NAILFOLD_QTOOLS flag to add the nailfold folder.


Download the SuiteSparse library from http://cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/ This contains the code for rapid cholesky factorization that is used in the solver for the flow estimation.


Extract all of the files from the .tar.gz file into a source directory (possibly into /src/vxl/external/ - maybe not).

[Further instructions on installing SuiteSparse]


Rerun CMake. It will give an error to say that FindSuiteSparse.cmake cannot be found etc. Set the SuiteSparse_DIR to the folder where SuiteSparse was installed. CMake will then search this folder for a SuiteSparseConfig.cmake file (which should be there) and set the include folders and such accordingly.


Set the include and library paths for the DMK files. (Set the library path to the parent folder that has the debug/ and release/ folders in it - this suffix will be added when the files are built.) At some point, I'll create a FindDMK.cmake file to do this.


Make any Qt changes that are needed (if any).
