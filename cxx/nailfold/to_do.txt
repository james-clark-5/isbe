Add some indicator of scale (though we'll need a way of knowing the magnification at which the images were captured).

Straighten out vessel properties altogether. Under the current system, the only way to unset an abnormal shape flag would be to set the vessel to 'undefined' or 'normal' then set the desired flags. Rubbish. The problem arises if we allow multiple shape flags (e.g. tortuous and ramified). If this is desired, we'll need checkboxes rather than radiobuttons.

Add an Undo feature. (This is actually a very involved process - currently there is no mechanism for reversing operations, certainly in the case of deleting vessels.)

Add hints on left/right mouse clicks to statusbar

Create different mouse cursors for different options?

Set inner point of the apex as that nearest the anchor point of the corresponding vessel

Add a way to indicate blood flow direction
