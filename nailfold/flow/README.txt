Mike,

To pick up the code as quickly as possible, I recommend you start with nailfold/flow/nonlinear_optimization/estimate_flow_multilevel.m and work your way back.

Many of the files in nailfold/flow are old and largely superseded by the the nonlinear optimization stuff. The ones that I'm pretty sure can be ignored/thrown away I've marked with 'PROBABLY JUNK NOW' in the first line.

The code is reasonably well commented anyway, but I'll keep a copy in case you have any questions.

Phil.
