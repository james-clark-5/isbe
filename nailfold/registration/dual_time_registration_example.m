%Prepare the frames - I've included all the optional arguments below with
%their default values, you shouldn't need to change these, but you might
%want to:
% - Increase offset_lim if it is too small to capture the motion between
% frames (the value is the number of pixels in each direction successive
% frames can move and still be matched)
% - Add a range of theta's if you think you are seeing rotational movement
% between frames
% - Play with different values of sigma - this will change the feature
% points used to match vessels between frames. Higher values of sigma pick
% large scale smoother vessels edges. A value about half the width (in
% pixels) of the vessel is probably about right
% - Change what output you display 1 = summary figures, 2 = full debug
% matching during registration. I suggest running with 2 to start with, and
% watching the registration in real-time to check frames are being matched
% appropriately
