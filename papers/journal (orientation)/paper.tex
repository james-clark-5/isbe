\begin{abstract}
Estimating orientation of image structure underpins applications including digital mammography, retinography and fingerprint analysis. We consider different choices of filter bank including those based on first and second derivatives, efficient Haar-like features and the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform. We then investigate how standard regressors (linear regression, Boosting and Random Forests) may be adapted to use the responses to these filter banks in order to predict orientation of image structure. For a quantitative evaluation, we use synthetic images based on mammograms and the publicly available DRIVE database of retinal images, and show that Random Forests and the wavelet transform offer superior accuracy though at a cost in efficiency. Qualitative results are also presented for real mammograms and fingerprint images.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item We begin by discussing the two techniques most important to this study: the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform; and Random Forests.

\item We then show that these can be used to detect curvilinear structure in images

\item We then show that they can be used to distinguish between different types of curvilinear structure (via a classifier)

\item We also show that similar techniques can be used to estimate orientation, which is useful in a number of applications.
\end{itemize}

%Breast screening programmes using x-ray mammography have been deployed widely to detect early signs of cancer. The use of computer-aided detection systems to support breast radiology experts is also widespread. In mammograms, the projection of a complex network of vessels, ducts and connective tissue in the breast results in images that are rich in linear structures at a variety of scales and orientations. Mammographic signs of cancer include: the presence of a radio-opaque mass, often with associated radiating curvilinear structures (spicules); the presence of microcalcifications (clusters of highly radio-opaque 'dots'); and the presence of abnormal or abnormally organised curvilinear structures (architectural distortion - AD). Fig 3(a) shows an approximately 4 x 4 cm region extracted from a mammogram, centred on a malignant tumour, and demonstrates a central mass and radiating spicules, along with normal curvilinear structures (vessels, ducts, glandular tissue etc). The signs of abnormality often appear in conjunction, but when only AD is present, detection of the abnormality is extremely difficult. It has been estimated that approximately a third of all cancers missed during mammographic screening present as AD [3], and it has been reported that computer-aided detection systems do not yet detect AD with adequate sensitivity or specificity [4].
%
%Previous attempts at detecting both patterns of spicules associated with malignant masses and more general distortions in which no focal mass is visible have employed a two stage approach comprising i) the detection of all curvilinear structures in a specified region, ii) an analysis of the orientation pattern of the detected structures to determine whether abnormal patterns are present [5-7]. The work we report here seeks to provide a firmer foundation for this approach by improving the detection of curvilinear structures and identifying those structures likely to be (abnormal) spicules.


\section{Background}
We conduct experiments in three domains: line detection, line classification, and orientation estimation.

Detecting curvilinear structure in an image (\eg~roads and rivers in aerial images, cracks in manufactured components, blood vessels and ducts in medical images) is difficult because these structures often appear at relatively low contrast against a cluttered background. To separate the meaningful structure from the background clutter, we adopt a discriminative learning approach based on the \dtcwt~\cite{Kingsbury_ACHA01} for local image representation and Random Forests~\cite{Breiman_ML01} for classification. This approach achieves high detection accuracy by taking account of the domain-specific characteristics of both the structures of interest and the background clutter.


\section{Conclusions}
From these experiments, we can make several conclusions. First, we see that filters based on first derivatives do indeed perform poorly near the centre of a ridge feature (\fref{f:fingerprints}b); second derivatives are much better, though they result in artefacts at the edges (where we are less concerned). Second, there is potential to approximate the second derivative filter responses with Haar-like features if efficiency is a key concern, though it is less clear how to combine these responses to give a unique solution. Of the filters we tested, we found that the \dtcwt~gave the best results regardless of the regressor used, though was significantly more computationally expensive. Of the regressors we tested, Random Forests performed best and we have provided some insight as to why alternatives (\eg~linear regression) perform less well. We must, however, take care when building regressors for orientation prediction in order to ensure that angles wrap around the circle correctly.


\section{Output definition}
[Describe here how the outputs of the regression are defined \ie~double-angled complex vector form. We'll need this early on so that the reader knows by the time we talk about the Random Forest regression. It could alternatively come between the image representation (inputs) and RF regression.]
