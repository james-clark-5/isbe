1) camera_rotation.mp4: video of the new camera hardware as described in section 2.1 of the paper. The rotation of the camera mount is driven at the touch of a button using an electronic linear actuator, with the axis of rotation in the focus plane of the lens so that the relative 3D geometry of the camera is the same for any tilt.

2) campture sequence.mp4: shreenshots of a nailfold video sequence being acquired (described in section 2.2 of the paper). Note the screengrab software used to create this example video has introduced artefacts in the live camera feed not observed during real-life imaging.


3) example_capillary.mp4: video of capillary blood flow, as shown in Figure 2c in the paper, played at x0.25 speed (it was recorded at 120fps, playback is at 30fps), highlighting the need for a high-frame-rate camera to adequately measure red blood cell velocity
