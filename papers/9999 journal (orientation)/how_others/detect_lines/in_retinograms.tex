Gabor filters~\cite{Soares_etal_TMI06}
second derivatives of a Gaussian~\cite{Staal_etal_TMI04}

Most methods are pretty basic, and consist of little more than image processing. There are, however, some properties of the vessel tree that are specific to this application (e.g. tree structure). Pick out these papers and discuss in more detail.
