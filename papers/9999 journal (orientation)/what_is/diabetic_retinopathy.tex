% Briefly describe the disease, and give figures for its prevalence or incidence, and estimated economic costs if available. 
An estimated XXX people suffer from diabetes in the US~\cite{source} and YYY in the UK~\cite{source}, and these numbers are rising. Of those suffering from diabetes, approximately Z\% will suffer from diabetic retinopathy -- the leading cause of legal blindness in people aged 20-74 in the United States, with an estimated annual cost of \$500 million in the US alone~\cite{Zhang_etal_JAMA10}.
\cite{Thomas_etal_BMJ12}.

% Also describe how (human) image analysis is used to improve treatment and reduce these costs.
Early diagnosis and treatment is key to improving quality of life and reducing the economic impact of the disease, and one way to diagnose retinopathy is by analysing images of the retina taken with a fundus camera. Indicators of retinopathy that are visible in the fundus image include presence of microaneurysms, haemorrhages and small patches of fat (exudates), variation in width along the vessels (venous beading), and the formation of new vessels (neovascularization).
