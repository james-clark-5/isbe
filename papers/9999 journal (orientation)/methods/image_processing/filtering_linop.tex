\label{s:filtering_linop}
The \emph{line operator}, or `LinOp'~\cite{Dixon_Taylor_IPC79}, is a variant of template matching that uses the responses to a template applied at multiple orientations and scales to describe an image patch.

% Mammography examples
Though originally applied to detecting asbestos fibres, it was later shown that LinOp could be na\"ively applied to mammograms~\cite{Parr_etal_SPIE97}, and also achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in a comparison of methods using simulated mammograms~\cite{Zwiggelaar_etal_TMI04}.
