% Details on how a Random Forest works specifically for detection

During classification, an unseen feature vector is classified independently by each tree in the forest; each tree casts a unit class vote, and the most popular class can be assigned to the input vector. Alternatively, the proportion of votes assigned to each class can be used to provide a probabilistic labelling of the input vector.
