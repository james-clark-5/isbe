To show qualitative results for real mammograms, the seven methods were applied to detect curvilinear structures in the malignant regions. Example detection results are shown in \ref{f:}.

\comment{In terms of applying the learning methods to real images, it is worth noting how the methods scale with increasing image size -- particularly above the point at which the set of feature vectors for all image pixels can be stored in working memory. For the \dtcwt{}, provided the initial decomposition can be stored in memory (which, due to its low-redundant decimating construction, is possible even for full size mammograms of the order $3000 \by 2400$ pixels) then interpolated coefficients can be efficiently sampled to generate feature vectors for block-wise regions of the image. Each block of feature vectors can be classified by the forest and cleared from working from memory storing only the output of the forest. In this way only a small overhead is introduced for block-wise classifying the image. 

However, for the other methods it becomes necessary to interleave the decomposition of the image with the sampling of feature vectors. For example, it may be necessary to apply the filters at a single scale, extract features for that scale for a particular block of the image, filter at the next scale and extract those features, and so on. Of course, when the complete feature vectors for a single block have been classified, the process repeats. Thus a large image may in fact end up by decomposed many times over introducing a large computational overhead for block-wise processing. The point at which this cost occurs will depend on the size of the image and the type of representation used. The cost is worst for Linop which requires storing 8 (\ie~the number orientations) full copies of the image at each scale, compared to just 3 for the Gaussian and Monogenic methods.}
