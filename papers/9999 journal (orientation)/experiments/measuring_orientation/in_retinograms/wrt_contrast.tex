To do so, we defined line contrast as the absolute difference between the vessel intensity and the mean intensity of background pixels in a $15{\times}15$ neighbourhood.

We see a similar effect when considering the distribution of error with respect to line contrast (\fref{f:retina_graphs}c): the learnt regressors outperform analytic methods especially on lines with low contrast though there is little significant difference between the methods for vessels of greater contrast. We also see errors begin to increase beyond a certain contrast, though this is most likely due again to the rarity of high contrast vessels and the correlation of high contrast with large width.
