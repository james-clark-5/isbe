Having trained regressors on synthetic mammogram-like images, we can also apply them to real mammograms. In a region of interest surrounding a spiculated lesion, the linear structures radiating from the central mass are clearly visible when weighted by the confidence in their orientation estimation (\fref{f:real_mammography}).

Having trained regressors on synthetic mammogram-like images, we can also apply them to real mammograms. Qualitative analysis of the results predictions verifies that the training data acts as a suitable surrogate for real data (although we would expect better predictions if ground truth labelled real data were available). For example, in a region of interest surrounding a spiculated lesion (\fref{f:real_mammography}a), the linear structures radiating from the central mass are clearly visible in the resulting orientation predictions weighted by the prediction confidence (\fref{f:real_mammography}b).
