Our database of real mammograms consisted of a sequential set of 84 abnormal mammograms with biopsy-proven malignancy, drawn from a screening population (Nightingale Breast Centre, South Manchester University Hospitals Trust, UK), and 89 normal mammograms from the same individuals, but of the contralateral breast (where disease was radiologically confirmed to be confined to one breast). All mammograms were digitised to a resolution of $90 \mu\text{m}$ using a Vidar CADPRO scanner. A $4 \by 4$ cm ($512 \by 512$ pixel) patch was then extracted around each abnormality, and a similar patch sampled randomly from each of the normal mammograms (\fref{f:real_examples}).

For each abnormal patch, an expert radiologist manually annotated 555 (not necessarily all) of the spicules associated with the abnormality, using in-house software. Though these expert spicule annotations were not sufficiently accurate to be used directly, we used them as a basis for selecting spicule pixels by initialising a snake~\cite{Kass_etal_IJCV88} with each original annotation, and iterating it to convergence using evidence from the \comment{linear structure probability?} image~\cite{Muralidhar_etal_TMI10}. In total, the 555 refined spicules identified 36\,514 spicule pixels.
