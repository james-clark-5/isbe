Detecting lines in retinograms enables us to segment the vessel tree from the background. This is useful for diagnosing or quantifying diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, as it enables us either to focus on the vessels (when measuring venous beading or neovascularization, for example) or to ignore the vessels and focus on the background (when counting microaneurysms, haemorrhages and exudates).
