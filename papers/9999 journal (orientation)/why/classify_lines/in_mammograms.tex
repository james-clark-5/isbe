The literature on classifying curvilinear structures in mammograms is limited. We are aware of one study that demonstrated the feasibility of distinguishing between different types of structure using cross-sectional profiles obtained from manually annotated curvilinear structures, but did not obtain very satisfactory results when the method was fully automated~\cite{Zwiggelaar_etal_TMI04}. We recently reported preliminary classification (but not detection) results using our current approach~\cite{Chen_etal_IWDM10}.

In mammography, however, we concentrated on the task of distinguishing between spicules (that are an indicator of malignancy) and other curvilinear structures, such as ducts, that are of little consequence.
