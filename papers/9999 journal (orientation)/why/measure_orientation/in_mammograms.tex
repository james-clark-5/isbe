In X-ray mammography, estimating the orientation of detected linear structures~\cite{Zwiggelaar_etal_TMI04} is important for many subsequent analysis tasks. For example, detecting the distinctive orientation patterns, formed by linear structures (known as spicules) that radiate from the central mass, can indicate the possible presence of a malignant lesion~\cite{Zwiggelaar_etal_MIA99,Karssemeijer_teBrake_TMI96,Rangayyan_Ayres_MBEC06}.
