At a low and intermediate level, knowing the orientation of curvilinear linear structure is important for steering computation~\cite{Sonka_99}, extracting profiles~\cite{Zwiggelaar_etal_TMI04,Staal_etal_TMI04}, grouping and tracking curvilinear features~\cite{Aylward_Bullitt_TMI02}, and directional filtering such as nonmaximal suppression and anisotropic diffusion~\cite{Perona_PAMI90}. 
%Estimating the local \emph{orientation} of curvilinear structure is also important, though the literature in this area is more limited~\cite{Freeman_Adelson_TPAMI91,Koenderink_vanDoorn_TPAMI92}.
Applications at a high level, however, are more diverse.

As well as knowing where the linear structures are, we may also wish to know where they are heading.
