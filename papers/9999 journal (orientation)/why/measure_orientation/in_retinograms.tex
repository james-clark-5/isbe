The rate of change of orientation (tortuosity) of blood vessels in a retinogram can serve as a diagnostic indicator of vascular disease such as retinopathy of prematurity~\cite{Wallace_TAOS07,Hart_etal_IJMI99}. Though studies suggest that vessels can be detected and segmented~\cite{Staal_etal_TMI04,Ricci_Perfetti_TMI07}, few have addressed the problem of measuring their orientation and quantifying tortuosity.
