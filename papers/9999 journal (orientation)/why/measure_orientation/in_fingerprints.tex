Automatic fingerprint matching relies upon estimating the orientation of ridges across the fingerprint. This typically begins by computing the orientation at every pixel via gradient-based filtering, often followed by some smoothing over a local patch~\cite{Bazen_Gerez_TPAMI02,Mei_etal_IVC09}. This orientation field is often parameterized -- via `phase portraits'~\cite{Li_etal_PR06} or polynomial approximation~\cite{Gu_etal_PR04} -- to capture and interpret the underlying properties of the fingerprint such as its `singular points' where the orientation is no longer defined (\eg~at a delta or the centre of a whorl). Orientation estimates at a local patch may then be smoothed ~\cite{Kass_Witkin_CVGIP87,Rao_Jain_TPAMI92,Perona_TIP98}.
